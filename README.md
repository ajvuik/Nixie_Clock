# Nixie Clock

This is a nixie clock based on an Atmel Atmega328 running on a 8Mhz external Xtal. It is programmed in Atmel Studio 7.0
and the PCB is designed in Fritzing.
Currently it uses 2 buttons to go through an extensive menu structure to configure the clock.
Power loss time keeping is done through an DS1307 module which can be bought in the more famous chinese on-line stores.

Do not use PCB's lower than 1.3, these have a bug that shorts out the powersupply!

Features:
	4/6 nixies
	Seconds colons on/of
	Tube saving by time/light or both
	Time restoring after powerloss by adding an DS1307 time keeper
	Settings are stored into EE-prom
	HV is generated by the Atmega328, so no need for external HV source
